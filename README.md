**THE HAYSTACK PROTOCOL
COOPER DOYLE & THOMAS NOMMENSEN**

Abstract. The IOTA Tangle is a distributed ledger which allows for decentralised storage and transfer of data. The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture underlying the Tangle creates the potential for feeless transactions between users and statistically indefinite network scalability. These features and the inherent decentralised nature of the Tanlge make IOTA an extremely attractive candidate for a anonymous and cryptographically secure communications protocol. The degree of anonymity of most tools available today is limited by the presence of communications metadata, which can be exploited by eavesdroppers to undermine the security of a network and gather information on users. Despite these issues, the idea of metadata resistance, or that of concealing not only the content, but also the context of communications, is scarcely addressed. In what follows we outline the requirements for a communications system to be anonymous, and present the Haystack Protocol over the IOTA Tangle as a solution.


** 1.__Introduction__ **
Metadata is used ubiquitously in communications as a means of facilitating the routing of messages between nodes on a network, and includes any information that can be used to distinguish a packet. While its use confers many advantages, such as speed and efficiency of the network, the metadata associated with packets is often easily exploited by an opponent to identify messages, gather information on users and reveal their communication channels. This information is not limited to the identities of the sender and receiver, their location, and the time of a conversation. Surveillance of metadata can be used to infer relationships between individuals, groups and even patterns in a user’s daily life. So important is the use of metadata in surveillance that the former director of the NSA, Michael Hayden, declared in a debate against Dr. David Cole, the National Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union, “We kill people based on metadata”.

The vast majority of communications systems available today make use of central servers to route messages, which not only requires trust in a central authority, but also renders the system vulnerable to metadata analysis. An eavesdropper who is able to observe traffic data between users and the server can invariably reconstruct the routing table of the network and gather statistical evidence of communication between clients, thereby compromising the integrity of the supposedly private channel. More sophisticated systems make use of decentralised, peer-to-peer relaying schemes which obfuscate the identity of senders and receivers, however, most are plagued with issues of reliability, scalability, speed and offline usability.

Here, we present a protocol which uses the IOTA Tangle as a platform for an anonymous and asynchronous communications network. That is, we require that users need not be online at the same time in order to successfully communicate. In this section we will first introduce the concepts of pseudo-anonymity and degree of anonymity, and explain the benefits of using the IOTA Tangle as a framework. We then present the Haystack protocol and consider a number of attack vectors and vulnerabilities. Finally, we discuss applications and perspectives for the future.


**1.1. __Pseudo-Anonymity, Blockchain, and the Tangle.__**
Blockchain and other consensus structures offer an inherently decentralised platform for transfer of value, storage of data, smart contracts and communications. Most available blockchain technologies feature a public ledger on which the history of all transactions associated with an addres are readily available to any user. In the case of Bitcoin, anonymity and privacy can only be achieved by keeping a wallet address hidden from the public, however this is an issue since an address must be revealed in order to complete or receive a transfer of value or data. IOTA solves this problem  by using virtually innumerable, unique, single-use addresses that are deterministically generated from a cryptographic seed. In this case, it is the seed and not the individual addresses that correspond to a user’s wallet. In order to retrieve a user’s balance and fetch any data associated with their transactions, a software wallet can scan the IOTA Tangle for addresses corresponding to the seed. These addresses are cryptographically generated, so that obtaining a seed from a series of corresponding addresses is virtually impossible. Thus, the transaction addresses only make available the information for a single transaction, and do not reveal the entire wallet or user’s history. For the sake of private messaging, this means that intercepting one message gives no information about the messages preceding or following it. This is known as unlinkability. In addition, by employing public key cryptography and digital signatures, the privacy and authenticity of the message content can be virtually guaranteed



Q: Who is Consensus?
A: Consensus is a group of physicists with an interest in anonymity, cybersecurity and freedom of information. We provide advice and in-depth analysis for businesses looking to employ new technologies or better understand technological markets. We're also developing several protocols using IOTA tangle to address such problems as secure anonymous communication and supply chain authentication.
