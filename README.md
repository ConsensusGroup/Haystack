Welcome to the Haystack protocol! The group developing this protocol is Consensus, we aim to help bring the IOTA tangle into the mainstream.

The Haystack protocol serves as the backbone of the upcoming messaging application. The protocol aims to become the most anonymous messaging platform on the internet. The app will be powered by the IOTA Tangle network and employs stochastic relaying methods to achieve a high degree of anonymity, scalability and security.

Q: How do I run the application?
A: At the current stage we have the dynamic ledger implemented and a working GUI for a simple messaging interface. To run the app, first clone this repo and go under the subdirectory: Haystack Alpha/Objective Programmed Functions/Version 1.01. In there will be two files called main.py and setup.sh. First execute the shell file for the installation process (sudo bash setup.sh) and once the installation is complete run the main.py python script. 

Q: Who is Consensus?
A: Consensus is a group of physicists with an interest in anonymity, cybersecurity and freedom of information. We provide advice and in-depth analysis for businesses looking to employ new technologies or better understand technological markets. We're also developing several protocols using IOTA tangle to address such problems as secure anonymous communication and supply chain authentication.
