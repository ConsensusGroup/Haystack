Welcome to the HayStack protocol! The group developing this protocol is Consensus which aims to mainstream the IOTA tangle network. 

The HayStack protocol serves as the backbone of the upcoming messaging application. The protocol aims to become the most anonymous messaging platform on the internet. The app will be powered by the IOTA Tangle network and employs a high level of scalability and security.

Q: How do I run the application?
A: At the current stage we have the dynamic ledger implemented and a working GUI for a simple messaging interface. To run the app, first clone this repo and go under the subdirectory: Haystack Alpha/Objective Programmed Functions/Version 1.01. In there will be two files called main.py and setup.sh. First execute the shell file for the installation process (sudo bash setup.sh) and once the installation is complete run the main.py python script.
